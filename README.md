# C_Utils
Utilities for C projects

As my mind seems to be as fickle as my luck, C_Utils doesn't really have a set goal of what I want it to be. At first it was a vast library of all possible things I would ever want to use in future projects, but seeing as literally of them actually exist in one way or another, this is going to be my experimentation and person projects in C. They are in essence going to be utilities, but they are not going to be the most efficient. 

C_Utils is going to be a personal side project that I will want to implement as libraries in future side projects. They're not for anyone else to use, just my own.


## Memory_Utils

### Summary

This is a theoretical and most likely not going to be finished at all, but as of yet, I've been experimenting with memory management and, in particular, garbage collection. I've already implemented my own simple garbage collector, thanks to a kind blogger who gave out his template, as I'll be trying to improve it as implement it in the other utilities as well.

## Concurrency_Utils

### Summary

A great way to take the opportunity to learn something new, especially in today's day and age, concurrency is king, without a doubt. Single-Threaded applications are a thing of the past, and I've only ever had to work with concurrency once, and while I've learned quite a bit, I don't know nearly enough. Concurrency_Utils be my attempt at implementing a nice and easy abstraction for creating threads, with the goal being that it'll be so easy you don't even have to know what the hell a thread is and be able create and use threads with my library.

Another thing I plan on implementing, which gets me excited, is a thread pool. While others do exist, mine may not be as good, but I plan on making it usable and viable, and of course, easy to use. This way you do not have to deal with threads at all. Just add it to the thread pool's job queue and let it do it's thing. So much stuff to do, so little time.
