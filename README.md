# Utilities Package for the C Programming Language

##Summary

Utilities Package for the C Programming Language, or C_Utils for short, is going to be my attempt at providing a full fledged package for various libraries, as both to provide useful tools for anyone to use, and for a learning experience. 

##About the Author

I am a Senior Computer Science student, but I declared late and haven't really found my passion for programming until half way through Junior Year, so needless to say, I am behind in my CS Curriculum, so this is my attempt at teaching myself what's needed of all comptuer science students without having to wait another year to learn what I should already know. Don't be discouraged and think that this will be a bad utilities package, for I definitely will try my best at completing it as best I possibly can, and make it as efficient and useful as well. 

##Utility Libraries available

### Thread Pool

Thread Pool implementation.

### String Utils

String manipulation library.

### File Utils

File I/O library

### Networking Utils

Networking library, offering functions for creating sockets and connections, a basic template for a client and server class, and HTTP protocol and parsing, along with FTP.

### Data Structures

Linked List, Priority Blocking Queue, Hash Map, Stack, etc. All thread safe.

### Misc Utils

Miscallaneous utilities package, featuring debugging tools such as logging and debugging macros and a timer.

## Notes:

Not all packages are finished yet, but this is what I hope to attain by the end of it all.
