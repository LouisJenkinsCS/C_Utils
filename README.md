# Utilities Package for the C Programming Language

##Summary

Utilities Package for the C Programming Language, dubbed C_Utils, contains a plethora of varying, but very useful abstractions for the modern day C programmer. It is designed to be easy to use and easy to read, and very newbie-friendly. As the C standard library is extremely minimal, I decided to create my own abstractions and package them to share them with others who may desire to use them. 

This project originally began as a way to teach myself the C Programming language, and so I am mainly self-taught. This may lead to some "weird" semantics and style choices, however this has been remedied as of March of 2016, by redesigning the entire library, to increase readability and overall control flow.

As of now, this project will be continued to be worked on and expanded on as I desire to learn new things. The amount of time spent developing this package has bordered on 800 hours now, and I do not think I'll ever be truly finished, as there are nearly infinitely many amount of things I can do. 

It should be noted once again, while this project is my "personal playground" does not mean it will be unusable to others.

#Documentation

The README.md has been significantly shortened, as it will later be used to specify how to install it once it is finished. The documentation can be found [here](http://theif519.github.io/slate/).

#Stable vs Development Branch

The stable branch is extremely outdated, and it is suggested that you instead view the development branch, linked below.
